Creates a custom post type to power a custom news feed

== Description ==

This plugin creates a custom news feed that can be read by the `Dashboard Custom Feed` plugin. News items are added through a custom post type called DCF Updates

This is mainly useful for notifying all your clients of something through their wordpress dashboard, whether that be a link to a new blog you've written or a notification asking everyone to upgrade their versions of wordpress. It's really up to you what you show in there.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `/Dashboard-Custom-Feed-Admin/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Settings > DCFA Settings` and enter the amount of items you want in the feed and the title of the feed that will show to the client.
